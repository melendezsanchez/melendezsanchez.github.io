I am Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University. In 2022-23, I was a <a href="https://www.usip.org/grants-fellowships/fellowships/peace-scholar-fellowship-program" target="_blank">USIP-Minerva Peace and Security Scholar</a> and a recipient of an <a href="https://apsanet.org/programs/doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grants/" target="_blank">APSA-NSF dissertation grant</a>. I am on the academic job market in 2024-25. You can find a copy of my CV <a href="{{ base_path }}/files/mms_cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I am a comparativist with a regional focus on Latin America. I study the causes of democratic durability, backsliding, and breakdown. Much of my work on these issues examines how organized crime and public insecurity undermine democratic institutions. 

My dissertation examines one major threat to democracy in Central America and Mexico: deliberate efforts by criminal organizations to influence elections, or what I call *criminal electioneering*. You can read more about my research and publications [here]({{ base_path }}/research). 

I have taught courses on the politics of organized crime, Central American and Latin American politics, authoritarianism, comparative politics, formal theory, and mixed methods. In 2021, I won the <a href="https://gsas.harvard.edu/news/manuel-melendez-sanchez-2021-derek-c-bok-award-citation." target="_blank">Derek C. Bok Award for Excellence in Graduate Student Teaching of Undergraduates</a>. You can find more information about my teaching [here]({{ base_path }}/teaching). 

You can find my general-audience commentary and analysis of Central American politics [here]({{ base_path }}/commentary). I have also consulted for the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/home" target="_blank">World Bank</a> and for the United States Agency for International Development (<a href="https://www.usaid.gov/" target="_blank">USAID</a>) through <a href="https://www.norc.org/" target="_blank">NORC</a> on projects related to strengthening democratic institutions in the region.

I have an A.B. from <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard College</a> and an M.Sc. from <a href="https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Oxford</a>, where I was a <a href="http://whtrust.org/" target="_blank">Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar</a> and a member of <a href="https://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">St. Antony's College</a>. I was born and raised in San Salvador, El Salvador.
