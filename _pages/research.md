I study the causes of democratic resilience, backsliding, and breakdown, with a focus on Latin America---and Central America in particular. In one set of projects, including my dissertation, I explore the relationship between organized crime, public security, and democracy. In other projects, I explore a broader range of challenges to contemporary democracies. You can find a list of publications and ongoing projects below.

My research has been supported by grants and fellowships from the <a href="https://apsanet.org/programs/doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grants/past-grantees/2022-ddri-grantees/" target="_blank">American Political Science Association/NSF</a>, the <a href="https://www.usip.org/" target="_blank">US Institute of Peace</a>, and the <a href="https://weissfund.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Weiss Fund for Research in Development Economics</a>, as well as by the <a href="https://drclas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">David Rockfeller Center for Latin American Studies</a>, the <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Institute for Quantitative Social Science</a>, and the <a href="https://wcfia.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Weatherhead Center for International Affairs</a>
