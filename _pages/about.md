I am Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University. In 2022-23, I was a <a href="https://www.usip.org/grants-fellowships/fellowships/peace-scholar-fellowship-program" target="_blank">USIP-Minerva Peace and Security Scholar</a> and a recipient of an <a href="https://apsanet.org/programs/doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grants/" target="_blank">APSA-NSF dissertation grant</a>. I will be on the academic job market in 2024-2025. You can find a copy of my CV <a href="{{ base_path }}/files/mms_cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I am a comparativist with a regional focus on Latin America. My dissertation examines what I call *criminal electioneering*---deliberate efforts by criminal groups to influence elections---in Central America and Mexico. In other ongoing work, I explore causes of regime stability and change. You can read more about my research and publications [here]({{ base_path }}/research). 

I have taught courses on the politics of organized crime, Central American and Latin American politics, authoritarianism, comparative politics, formal theory, and mixed methods. You can find more information about my teaching [here]({{ base_path }}/teaching). 

You can find my general-audience commentary and analysis of Central American politics [here]({{ base_path }}/commentary). I have also consulted for the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home) and for the United States Agency for International Development ([USAID](https://www.usaid.gov/)) through [NORC](https://www.norc.org/Pages/default.aspx) on projects related to strengthening democratic institutions in the region.

I have an A.B. from [Harvard College](https://college.harvard.edu/) and an M.Sc. from [Oxford](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/), where I was a [Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar](http://whtrust.org/) and a member of [St. Antony's College](https://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/). I was born and raised in San Salvador, El Salvador.
