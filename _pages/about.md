I am an incoming Postdoctoral Visiting Fellow at the University of Notre Dame's <a href="https://kellogg.nd.edu/" target="_blank">Kellogg Institute for International Studies</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from <a href="https://www.gov.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> in 2025. You can find a copy of my CV <a href="{{ base_path }}/files/mms_cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I am a comparativist with a regional focus on Latin America. I study the roots of democratic resilience, backsliding, and breakdown. Much of my work on these issues examines how organized crime and public insecurity undermine democratic institutions. I have conducted extensive fieldwork in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. You can read more about my research and publications [here]({{ base_path }}/research). 

I have taught courses on the politics of organized crime, Central American and Latin American politics, authoritarianism, comparative politics, formal theory, and mixed methods. In 2021, I won the <a href="https://gsas.harvard.edu/news/manuel-melendez-sanchez-2021-derek-c-bok-award-citation." target="_blank">Derek C. Bok Award for Excellence in Graduate Student Teaching of Undergraduates</a>. You can find more information about my teaching [here]({{ base_path }}/teaching). 

I have an A.B. from <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard College</a> and an M.Sc. from <a href="https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Oxford</a>, where I was a <a href="http://whtrust.org/" target="_blank">Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar</a> and a member of <a href="https://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">St. Antony's College</a>. I was born and raised in San Salvador, El Salvador.
